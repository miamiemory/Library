        <p style="height: 86px"><span class="style12">The Randolph Public Library Board of Trustees consists of nine members appointed by the Board of Commissioners to six year terms, and represent the county geographically. Ex officio (non-voting) members include the County Library Director and Assistant Director; a liaison representing the Asheboro City Council, appointed by their mayor; and a liaison representing the Friends of the Library, appointed by their president.</span><br /><br />
        </p>
        <p align="left"><span class="style7">The board meets at 1 p.m. on the second Thursday of January, April, July and October at the Asheboro Public Library, 201 Worth Street, Asheboro, N.C.</span> </p>
          <p span class="style12">The Trustees serve as a bridge of communication between the 
          community and the library, and as such, solicit input concerning the 
          library from patrons. The Trustees, in their role as advocates, aid in 
          presenting the library perspective to local, state and federal 
          lawmakers. The Trustees approve library policies; establish a schedule 
          of fines and charges for the late return of, failure to return, damage 
          to and loss of library materials; administer the Library Trust Fund; and 
          serve as the final authority concerning the disposition of any library 
          materials challenged in writing in accordance with library procedures as 
          being objectionable. The Trustees also may request a performance 
          evaluation of the Library Director from the County Manager.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
